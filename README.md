Virtual-Piano-Player
=================
Virtual piano player lets you play a music sheet. What it does is to simulate key strokes accordingly to the music sheet.

How it works:
-the notes between "[" and "]" are played at the same time
-"-" and " " make a pause between notes
-to set a personalized pause write the pause time between "{" and "}" (eg: pfdfhf {200} asdf, this will set a 200 ms break between "pfdfhf" and "asdf")



To test this application open the Virtual-Piano-Player.jar.

To use this application:
-go to virtualpiano.net in your favourite browser
-copy or write a music sheet in the application
-set your opotions for the elapsed time between notes accordingly
-press the "Play" button
-switch to the virtualpiano.net webpage and the song will start playing (you must switch to the webpage in less than 3 seconds - you can change this delay in the application)


TO STOP the application from playing just go with your mouse in the TOP-LEFT corner of your display.
